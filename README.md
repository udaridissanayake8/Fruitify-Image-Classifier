## 📋 Overview

**Fruitify** is a deep learning-based image classification system developed for COM 3303 - Artificial Intelligence mini project. The system uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically identify and classify different types of fruits from digital images.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- ✅ Design and implement a CNN-based fruit classification model
- ✅ Preprocess and augment fruit image dataset
- ✅ Achieve minimum 85% classification accuracy
- ✅ Compare baseline vs improved model performance
- ✅ Demonstrate practical AI application in food recognition

## 🗂️ Dataset

- **Source:** [Fruit-360 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moltean/fruits) from Kaggle
- **Classes:** 10 fruit categories
  - Apple, Banana, Orange, Strawberry, Grape
  - Mango, Pineapple, Watermelon, Peach, Pear
- **Images:** ~5,000 total (500 images per class)
- **Split:** 64% Training | 16% Validation | 20% Testing
